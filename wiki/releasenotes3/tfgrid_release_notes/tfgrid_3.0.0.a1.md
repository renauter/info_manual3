### Proof of Utilization

- Resource utilisation is captured and calculated on hourly basis
- Resource utilisation stored in TFChain
- An automated discount system has been put in place, rewarding users who pre-purchased their cloud needs. Price discounts are applied, in line with amount of TFT you have in your account and the period you are holding these TFT.
E.g. if you have 12 months worth of TFT in your account in relation to the last hour used capacity you get 40% discount, 36 months results in 60% discount.
